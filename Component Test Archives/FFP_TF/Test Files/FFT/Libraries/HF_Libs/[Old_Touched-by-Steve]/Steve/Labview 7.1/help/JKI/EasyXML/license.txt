market, license, distribute, transfer, sublicense or otherwise commercially 
exploit the Product, except as expressly permitted herein; (b) permit the use 
of the Product by others, except that you may permit your third party

Confidential Information and will use the Product only in accordance with the 
terms of this Agreement; (c) modify or create derivative works of the Product 
nor translate or port the Product into any other computer or human language

remain in JKI and its suppliers.  The Product is protected by copyright, 
trademark, trade secret and other proprietary rights of JKI, and you do not 
acquire any rights, express or implied, in the Product, other than those 
specified in this Agreement.  No title to or ownership of the Product, or 
copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights in any Product 
are transferred to you under this Agreement.  All modifications, adjustments, 
error corrections or other updates to the Product will become part of the 
Product, as applicable, and will remain the exclusive property of JKI.

2.	Use of Third Party Software:  
(a)  You understand that the Product is or includes tools that access, 
interact with and/or utilize software object and/or source code obtained by 
JKI from third parties and that are separate from the Product (the "Third 
Party Software").  (For purposes of this Agreement, the Product and any Third 
Party Software shall be referred to as the "Software".)  Together with its 
distribution to you of the Product, JKI is making some Third Party Software 
available to you via download or other distribution.   In addition, following 
your installation of the Product, the Product will be able to and will, based 
on your instruction, connect to the internet and identify additional Third 
Party Software for download and installation on your computer on your behalf.  
You understand and agree that all such Third Party Software is made available 
to you by JKI for the sole purpose of facilitating your download, 
installation, use, evaluation and testing of the Product.  You further 
acknowledge and agree that your use and distribution of any such Third Party 
Software is subject to the terms of the applicable Third Party Software 
license(s), and that you will comply with the terms of such Third Party 
Software license(s). You expressly acknowledge and agree that, prior to using 
the Third Party Software for any other purpose, and in any case before 
copying, modifying, or distributing any Third Party Software, you will confirm 
that you have all necessary rights and permissions to do so from the 
applicable third party licensor (the "Licensor"), which confirmation may 
include obtaining a separate license from the Licensor expressly authorizing 
you to do so.  

3.	You Will Not Use nor Disclose Our Confidential Information.  Confidential 
Information hereunder includes, but is not limited to, JKI Product 
specifications, Product source code, trade secrets, know-how, inventions 
(whether or not patentable), techniques, processes, programs, ideas, 
algorithms, schematics, testing procedures, software design and architecture, 
internal documentation, design and function specifications, product 
requirements, analysis and performance information, benchmarks, software 
documents, and other non-public technical, business, product, marketing and 
financial information, plans and data of JKI (the "Confidential Information"). 
 You agree that all Confidential Information is the confidential property of 
JKI and, except with JKI's prior written consent or as required (and then only 
to the extent required) by law, you agree to use any Confidential Information 
you obtain only as permitted by this Agreement, and not to disclose any 
Confidential Information to third parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you 
may disclose Confidential Information only to those of your employees and 
consultants as is necessary for the use expressly and unambiguously licensed 
hereunder, and only after such employees and contractors have agreed in 
writing to be bound by the obligations of nondisclosure at least as 
restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Your nondisclosure 
obligations hereunder shall not apply to information you can document: (i) is 
generally available to the public other than through breach of this Agreement; 
(ii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any associated 
obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) is independently developed by you 
without use of any JKI Confidential Information. Because of the unique and 
proprietary nature of the Confidential Information, you understand and agree 
that JKI's remedies at law for your breach of your obligations under this 
Section may be inadequate and that JKI shall be entitled to seek equitable 
relief (including without limitation provisional and permanent injunctive 
relief and specific performance). Nothing stated herein shall limit any other 
remedies provided under this Agreement or available to JKI at law. Upon 
expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you will return or 
destroy all copies of all JKI Confidential Information in your possession or 
control.

interest (including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, 
moral rights or trade secret rights) in or to: (a) the Product (including any 
changes, modifications or corrections thereto) and/or (b) the Feedback, 
whether by virtue of your provision of Feedback to JKI or otherwise, then you 
hereby irrevocably assign to JKI all such right, title and interest. Such

rights; provided that any non-assignable moral rights are waived to the extent 
permitted by law), trade secret rights, mask work rights, sui generis database 
rights and all other intellectual and industrial property rights of any sort 
with respect thereto that in any way relate to or constitute the Feedback or 
the Product. In the event that any such rights (including, by way of example 
and without limitation, "moral rights," or other similar rights) cannot be 
assigned, you hereby agree to waive enforcement worldwide of such rights 
against JKI and hereby grant to JKI an exclusive, fully paid, worldwide, 
irrevocable, perpetual license, with right to sublicense through multiple
