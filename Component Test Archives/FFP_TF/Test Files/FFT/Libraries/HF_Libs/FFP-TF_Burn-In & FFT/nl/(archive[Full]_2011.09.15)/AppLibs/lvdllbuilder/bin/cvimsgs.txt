5433   "  This instrument driver provides programming support for %s.\n" "  It contains functions for opening, configuring, taking measurements from, and\n" "  closing the instrument.\n\n"
5434   "\n  Assumptions:\n\n"
5435   "  To successfully use this module, the following conditions must be met:\n\n" "  For GPIB instrument drivers:\n" "         -  the instrument is connected to the GPIB.\n" "         -  the GPIB address supplied to the initialize function must match the\n" "            GPIB address of the instrument.\n\n"
5436   "  For VXI instrument drivers:\n" "         -  the instrument is installed in the VXI mainframe and you are\n" "            using one of the following controller options:\n" "                  Embedded controller\n" "                  MXI\n" "                  MXI2\n" "                  GPIB-VXI\n"
5437   "         -  the logical address supplied to the initialize function must\n" "            match the logical address of the instrument.\n\n"
5438   "  For RS-232 instrument drivers:\n" "         -  the instrument is connected to the RS-232 interface.\n" "         -  the COM port, baud rate, parity, and timeout supplied to the\n" "            initialize function must match the settings of the instrument.\n\n"
5439   "\n  Error and Status Information:\n\n"
5440   "  Each function in this instrument driver returns a status code that\n" "  either indicates success or describes an error or warning condition.\n" "  Your program should examine the status code from each call to an\n" "  instrument driver function to determine if an error occurred.\n" "  The general meaning of the status code is as follows:\n\n"
5441   "       Value                  Meaning\n" "       -------------------------------\n" "       0                      Success\n" "       Positive Values        Warnings\n" "       Negative Values        Errors\n\n" "  The description of each instrument driver function lists possible error\n" "  codes and their meanings\n\n"
5442   "\n  How To Use This Document:\n\n" "  Use this document as a programming reference manual.\n" "  It describes each function in the\n\n"
5443   "\n  %s.  The functions appear in alphabetical order, with a description" " of the function and its %s syntax, a description of each" " parameter, and a list of possible error codes.\n"
