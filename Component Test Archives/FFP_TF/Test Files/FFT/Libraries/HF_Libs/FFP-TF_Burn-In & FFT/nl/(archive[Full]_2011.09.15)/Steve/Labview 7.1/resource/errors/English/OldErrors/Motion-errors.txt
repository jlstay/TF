Motion:  Command packet length is incorrect.  Your FlexMotion controller firmware may be out of date.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70012">
Motion:  Illegal board ID. You must use the board ID assigned to your controller in Measurement & Automation Explorer.

<nierror code="-70011">
Motion:  Corrupt readback data. The data returned by the motion controller is corrupt.

Motion:  The function called previous to this one is not supported by this type of controller.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70007">
Motion:  A previous function is currently being executed, so the controller cannot accept this function until the previous function has completed.  If this problem persists, try putting a delay between the offending commands.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70006">
Motion:  For ValueMotion, an invalid axis number was used. For FlexMotion, an invalid axis number or other resource ID (Vector Space, Encoder, I/O Port, and so on) was used.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70005">
Motion:  Most likely, your controller is not installed or configured properly.  If this error persists when you know your controller is installed and configured properly, it indicates an internal hardware failure.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70004">
Motion:  Partial readback packet. The data returned by the controller is incomplete. The kernel driver timed out after getting partial data.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70003">
Motion:  No data in the Return Data Buffer.  The kernel driver returns an error if it runs out of time waiting for the controller to return data to the Return Data Buffer. For FlexMotion controllers, this error can also be returned if the power-up state of the controller has not been cleared.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70002">
Motion:  Either this function is not supported by this type of controller, or the controller received an incomplete command packet and cannot execute the function.
</nierror>
<nierror code="-70001">
Motion:  Ready to Receive Timeout. The controller is still not ready to receive commands after the specified timeout period. This error may occur if the controller is busy processing previous commands. If this error persists, even when the controller should not be busy, contact National Instruments.
